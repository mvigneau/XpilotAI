There are a lot of files, but to let's try to keep it short. 

There are 3 agents "TigerKing, Dumpster, Rabbit". 

They each have a file with _GA, _Learning, _Agent and a .xls data file. 

The _GA files contains the main methods for the genetic algorithm to run properly for each agent. 
The _Learning files contains everything needed for the agent to run smoothly and learn at the same time. When you want to execute some training, use this file. 

The _Agent files are the ones that have our most optimal agent thus far based-off previous training against a specific agent. ** Note that it might not perform well if put in totally different environment with a different opponent. 

The .xls files are basically excel files storing data about the learning. For each generation ran, it stores important information about the current population. 

There are also some Program1_... files, but we ended up not utilizing them as these agents were too bad to train against them. 

The website we have made should contain more information about the project as well as some results.
